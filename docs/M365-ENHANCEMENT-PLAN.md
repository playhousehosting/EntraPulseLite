# EntraPulse Lite M365 Enhancement Plan
## Transforming EntraPulse Lite into "The M365 of Claude/OpenAI" for Administrators and MSPs

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancement strategy to transform EntraPulse Lite from a basic Entra ID management tool into a full-featured Microsoft 365 administration platform designed specifically for administrators and Managed Service Providers (MSPs).

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
EntraPulse Lite currently provides:
- **Basic Entra ID Operations**: User profiles, group memberships, application registrations
- **Limited Microsoft Graph Coverage**: Primary focus on `/me`, basic `/users`, `/groups`, `/applications`
- **Authentication Modes**: Enhanced Graph Access (Microsoft Graph PowerShell) and Custom Application modes
- **MCP Architecture**: Sophisticated Multi-Client Protocol implementation with fallback strategies

### Key Limitations Identified
1. **Narrow Service Scope**: Focused primarily on Entra ID/Azure AD, missing comprehensive M365 ecosystem
2. **No MSP Features**: Lacks multi-tenant management, client isolation, billing integration
3. **Limited Admin Workflows**: No pre-built templates for common administrative tasks
4. **Basic Reporting**: No export capabilities or compliance reporting features
5. **Minimal Security Operations**: Missing security center integration, incident management
6. **No Bulk Operations**: Lacks PowerShell-like scripting and automation capabilities
